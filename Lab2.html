        <p>
            My name is Alex, I am currently enrolled in BCIT CIT course for the next few years.
            My hobbies include Gaming, Listening to music, and going for walks to explore the city.
            I <em>really</em> enjoy listening to music, I would argue it is my favorite pasttime, I probably listen to music for about 10 hours of the day
            In school, we are currently learning about <strong>Python</strong>, which is enjoyable enough, aswell as HTML language.
        </p>
