        My name is Alex, I am currently enrolled in BCIT CIT course for the next
        few years. My hobbies include Gaming, Listening to music, and going for
        walks to explore the city. I <em>really</em> enjoy listening to music, I
        would argue it is my favorite pasttime, I probably listen to music for
        about 10 hours of the day In school, we are currently learning about
        <strong>Python</strong>, which is enjoyable enough, aswell as HTML
        language.
